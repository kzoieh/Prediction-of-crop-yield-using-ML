# Prediction-of-crop-yield-using-ML
Implemented a model that focuses on predicting the crop yield in advance by analysing states, their geographical area, gross
agricultural land area availability and respective production for given years through supervised machine learning regression
algorithms like Linear Regression, KNN, and Random Forest Algorithm on previously collected datasets.
